Introduction Dark Knight (DRK) is one of the four tanks available in Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker. Its rotation features large bursts of damage, accompanied by spikes in actions per minute (APM) and requires managing both MP and a Blood Gauge, putting many hard-hitting attacks into party raid buff windows.

This section will list some General-purpose DRK openers which work relatively well in most situations.</description></item><item><title>Dark Knight FAQ</title><link>https://thebalanceffxiv.fpo.website/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/faq/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2022 23:54:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thebalanceffxiv.fpo.website/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/faq/</guid><description>Frequently Asked Questions Why can’t I fit five GCDs in Blood Weapon (or Delirium)?

As long as you are weaving Blood Weapon late and keeping the GCD rolling during it, five GCDs in Blood Weapon should be very consistent.

If you are already confident in your job as a tank, feel free to skip ahead to the last section, which covers the evolution of your rotation as you level up to max.
