So, it’s important to keep on top of GNB, especially at Level 70 due to sync for The Weapon’s Refrain (Ultimate) and The Unending Coil of Bahamut (Ultimate).
No Mercy is unlocked at level 2, so it’s used in all forms of content from the beginning of A Realm Reborn up to current content in Endwalker.</description></item><item><title>Gunbreaker FAQ</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/faq/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2022 21:06:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/faq/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Gunbreaker Skills Overview</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2022 21:05:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/skills-overview/</guid><description>Gunbreaker Skills Overview Offensive On Global Cool Down Abilities Keen Edge The first skill of our basic combo. 170 potency.

As such, some fights will require earlier (or even Prepull NM) to optimize more or to gain usages of Blasting Zone or Gnashing Fang (P3S). However when in doubt you can follow the 1-2-3-NM! Opener until you encounter a fight requiring an alternate approach
As content is released, various openers may be utilized from fight to fight for all manner of reasons.</description></item><item><title>Gunbreaker Stat Priority</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Feb 2022 00:14:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/stat-priority/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Gunbreaker Advanced Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Oct 2021 21:43:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/advanced-guide/</guid><description>What’s Next After The Basics?
