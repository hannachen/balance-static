This information on this page is to give useful tips to help you as you are leveling DNC. This guide will focus on which skills and abilities are available to you in each level range, and will indicate at which levels you get actions that affect your rotation and how they affect it.
Basics Gear First of all, the gear you get from the quest unlocking DNC is not the best gear you can wear on DNC at level 60.</description></item><item><title>Dancer FAQ</title><link>https://thebalanceffxiv.fpo.website/jobs/ranged/dancer/faq/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jun 2022 02:19:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thebalanceffxiv.fpo.website/jobs/ranged/dancer/faq/</guid><description>DANCE PARTNER PRIORITY This list is made in a gear/skill vacuum. This is the recommended partner priority list.
Special Note: some fights may favor certain Dance Partners over others based on phases/mechanics or ability to hit multiple targets.
Updated: January 19, 2021 to account for balance changes in patch 5.4.
SAM NIN MNK / BLM (crit build)* DRG / SMN RDM MCH BRD DNC *Data on BLM SpS build as a dance partner is not available due to length in time to reach BiS with this build as of this update, but value as a dance partner is believed to drop significantly between the two builds due to under utilization of Devilment.</description></item><item><title>Dancer Advanced Guide</title><link>https://thebalanceffxiv.fpo.website/jobs/ranged/dancer/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Apr 2022 23:53:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thebalanceffxiv.fpo.website/jobs/ranged/dancer/advanced-guide/</guid><description>by Io Whitespirit (Faerie)
FOREWORD
One of the biggest requests I have had is a more concise document on what people “need to know” before jumping into more difficult content. This is not meant to be a replacement for a general guide to Dancer; please see Ringabel’s extensive write-up instead, which will be linked at the end of the document in the appendix.
This guide will be broken down into three sections: Basics, Intermediate, and Advanced.</description></item><item><title>Dancer Stat Priority</title><link>https://thebalanceffxiv.fpo.website/jobs/ranged/dancer/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Feb 2022 23:18:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thebalanceffxiv.fpo.website/jobs/ranged/dancer/stat-priority/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
