As a result of there being no damage buff it should be used slightly differently than in level 80 and 90 content.
While you should still aim to finish phases with as much Black and White mana as possible, in the scenario that your mana is at 50 | 50 or below, you can use Manafication during downtime during or between phases to get it on cooldown faster.</description></item><item><title>The Weapon's Refrain (Ultimate) Guide</title><link>https://thebalanceffxiv.fpo.website/jobs/casters/red-mage/fight-tips/the-weapons-refrain-ultimate-guide/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Aug 2022 01:02:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thebalanceffxiv.fpo.website/jobs/casters/red-mage/fight-tips/the-weapons-refrain-ultimate-guide/</guid><description>General Fight Tips Managing Resources Due to damage scaling in Endwalker, push timings in The Weapon’s Refrain can vary greatly, between groups and even between pulls in the same group. Therefore, you should use this guide for a general idea of how to manage each phase, but keep in mind this may not always work for you, and you should aim to find a timeline that works for you during progression.</description></item><item><title>Asphodelos Raid Guide</title><link>https://thebalanceffxiv.fpo.website/jobs/casters/red-mage/fight-tips/asphodelos/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2022 19:24:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thebalanceffxiv.fpo.website/jobs/casters/red-mage/fight-tips/asphodelos/</guid><description>Red Mage Asphodelos Encounter Advice For information on Addle and Magick Barrier usage, see https://bit.ly/3AHEMxZ
P1S Intemperance Embolden should be used on cooldown, with the two-minute and six-minute buff windows occurring during Intemperance.
For the first Intemperance, as there is a delay between the Intemperance cast and the first set of tiles exploding, you can stand in the center of the arena to cast Embolden before moving out to your tile.</description></item></channel></rss>
