Q: Are there any Shukuchi macros?
A: Yes, the main ones use either to go to your target at the time, or use &amp;lt;1&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;2&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;3&amp;gt;, etc to go to specific party members.
Q: Why does our BiS not follow the stat priority?
A: Because of stat tiering and how it works together with our rotation, our rotation simulation brought out this exact combination of materia to be a higher average DPS value than fully following our stat priority.</description></item><item><title>Ninja Openers</title><link>https://thebalanceffxiv.fpo.website/jobs/melee/ninja/openers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2022 06:34:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thebalanceffxiv.fpo.website/jobs/melee/ninja/openers/</guid><description>⦿ Late weave Trick Attack as much as possible without clipping.

Overview Ninja is a fast-paced yet flexible job with a high focus on a powerful burst every one and two minutes. It is unique from other jobs with its utilization of Ninjutsus, a combo-like system that allows a Ninja to form a multitude of ranged attacks. We have a personal buff every minute (Trick Attack) where we emphasize landing all of our biggest attacks within 15.</description></item><item><title>Ninja Leveling Guide</title><link>https://thebalanceffxiv.fpo.website/jobs/melee/ninja/leveling-guide/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2022 06:31:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thebalanceffxiv.fpo.website/jobs/melee/ninja/leveling-guide/</guid><description>This guide was written by Akashi Seraph for players who are seeking to, or are currently leveling Ninja.
