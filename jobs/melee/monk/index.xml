Certain actions will deal more damage when executed from the rear or flank of a target. Targets with continuous Target Rings will always take the increased damage from positional actions.
The Role Action True North allows you to disregard positional requirements for ten seconds per use.
While it is a loss to miss your Positionals, landing them should be your last priority, after you have met all of the other combat priority requirements of a melee DPS job.</description></item><item><title>Monk Advanced Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Apr 2022 21:05:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/advanced-guide/</guid><description>Advanced Monk Gameplay Techniques: Reaching Enlightenment Opener Variations The two basic opener choices are not going to work perfectly in every situation. As such, we can modify our openers quite easily in order to better suit our needs.
Early Openers An early opener is exactly what it sounds like. By skipping past the Opo GCD straight into a Twin Snakes, we are able to get our buffs on cooldown sooner.</description></item><item><title>Monk Skills Overview</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Feb 2022 12:19:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/skills-overview/</guid><description>Single Target GCDs Monk has six core single-target GCDs:
Bootshine has a potency of 210, or 310 when you have Leaden Fist. When in Opo-Opo form, Bootshine will always crit. Dragon Kick has a potency of 320. When in Opo-Opo form, it will grant the Leaden Fist buff. True Strike has a potency of 300.</description></item><item><title>Monk Openers</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/openers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Feb 2022 11:38:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/openers/</guid><description>Openers Lunar Solar Double Solar Early Lunar Solar Early Double Solar Other Resources Video Guide: Monk Openers Explained

As purely the best option, yup, go back to 1:1 Twin Snakes and True.
What&amp;rsquo;s with the double Dragon Kick in the openers?
With Standard, you DK after Perfect Balance for DK&amp;rsquo;s higher potency and again later to gain Leaden finally. With Early Buff a stanceless Leaden Boot after PB is worse on average than using the DK to guarantee a crit one.</description></item></channel></rss>
